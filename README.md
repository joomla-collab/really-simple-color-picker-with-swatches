# Really simple jQuery color picker with swatches

----

This is a clean color picker for when you just need to offer a few colors/swatches and to pass the color as a variable somewhere else.

The swatches are generated on-the-fly, from an array with hexa codes without the #. The current array is populated with 64 colors that I needed for a project, but are not an actual representation of a balanced palette.

This example has two pickers because my project required it, but you can just remove half of it.

Note: Some customization necessary.
